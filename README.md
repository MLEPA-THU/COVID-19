# 2019-CoVirus-RNNpredict - Still Pending 
We apply a reccurent neural network model on the data released by WHO related to Coronavirus spread. We used the Seq2Seq Algorithm developped by Google.

The data was released by World Health Organization. The file "coronavrisu.csv" is the modified file. In fact, I worked on the first data file to prepare a new one which sums all the numbers of confirmed cases, deaths and recovered cases.
